      UNA OF THE HILL COUNTRY
    </h1>
    <h2>
      By Charles Egbert Craddock <br /> <br /> 1911
    </h2>

    <p>
      The old sawmill on Headlong Creek at the water-gap of Chilhowee Mountain
      was silent and still one day, its habit of industry suggested only in the
      ample expanse of sawdust spread thickly over a level open space in the
      woods hard by, to serve as footing for the &ldquo;bran dance&rdquo; that had been so
      long heralded and that was destined to end so strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      A barbecue had added its attractions, unrivalled in the estimation of the
      rustic epicure, but even while the shoats, with the delectable flavor
      imparted by underground roasting and browned to a turn, were under
      discussion by the elder men and the sun-bonneted matrons on a shady slope
      near the mill, where tablecloths had been spread beside a crystal spring,
      the dance went ceaselessly on, as if the flying figures were insensible of
      fatigue, impervious to hunger, immune from heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed the youths and maidens of the contiguous coves and ridges had
      rarely so eligible an opportunity, for it is one of the accepted tenets of
      the rural religionist that dancing in itself is a deadly sin, and all the
      pulpits of the countryside had joined in fulminations against it Nothing
      less than a political necessity had compassed this joyous occasion. It was
      said to have been devised by the &ldquo;machine&rdquo; to draw together the largest
      possible crowd, that certain candidates might present their views on
      burning questions of more than local importance, in order to secure
      vigorous and concerted action at the polls in the luke-warm rural
      districts when these measures should go before the people, in the person
      of their advocates, at the approaching primary elections. However, even
      the wisdom of a political boss is not infallible, and despite the
      succulent graces of the barbecue numbers of the ascetic and jeans-clad
      elder worthies, though fed to repletion, collogued unhappily together
      among the ox-teams and canvas-hooded wagons on the slope, commenting
      sourly on the frivolity of the dance. These might be relied on to cast no
      ballots in the interest of its promoters, with whose views they were to be
      favored between the close of the feast and the final dance before sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trees waved full-foliaged branches above the circle of sawdust and
      dappled the sunny expanse with flickering shade, and as they swayed apart
      in the wind they gave evanescent glimpses of tiers on tiers of the faint
      blue mountains of the Great Smoky Range in the distance, seeming ethereal,
      luminous, seen from between the dark, steep, wooded slopes of the narrow
      watergap hard by, through which Headlong Creek plunged and roared. The
      principal musician, perched with his fellows on a hastily erected stand,
      was burly, red-faced, and of a jovial aspect. He had a brace of fiddlers,
      one on each side, but with his own violin under his double-chin he alone
      &ldquo;called the figures&rdquo; of the old-fashioned contradances. Now and again,
      with a wide, melodious, sonorous voice, he burst into a snatch of song:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Shanghai chicken he grew so tall,
          In a few days&mdash;few days,
     Cannot hear him crow at all&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Sometimes he would intersperse jocund personal remarks in his
      Terpsichorean commands: &ldquo;Gents, forward to the centre&mdash;back&mdash;swing:
      the lady ye love the best.&rdquo; Then in alternation, &ldquo;Ladies, forward to the
      centre&mdash;back&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and as the mountain damsels teetered in
      expectation of the usual supplement of this mandate he called out in
      apparent expostulation, &ldquo;<i>Don't</i> swing him, Miss&mdash;he don't wuth
      a turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the tune changed and with great gusto he chanted forth:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;When fust I did a-courtin' go,
     Says she 'Now, <i>don't</i> be foolish, Joe,'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      the <i>tempo rubato</i> giving fresh impetus to the kaleidoscopic whirl of
      the dancers. The young men were of indomitable endurance and manifested a
      crude agility as they sprang about clumsily in time to the scraping of the
      fiddles, while their partners shuffled bouncingly or sidled mincingly
      according to their individual persuasion of the most apt expression of
      elegance. Considered from a critical point of view the dance was
      singularly devoid of grace&mdash;only one couple illustrating the
      exception to the rule. The youth it was who was obviously beautiful, of a
      type as old as the fabled Endymion.
    </p>
    <p>
      His long brown hair hung in heavy curls to the collar of his butternut
      jeans coat; his eyes were blue and large and finely set; his face was fair
      and bespoke none of the midday toil at the plow-handles that had tanned
      the complexion of his compeers, for Brent Kayle had little affinity for
      labor of any sort. He danced with a light firm step, every muscle supplely
      responsive to the strongly marked pulse of the music, and he had a lithe,
      erect carriage which imparted a certain picturesque effect to his
      presence, despite his much creased boots, drawn over his trousers to the
      knee, and his big black hat which he wore on the back of his head. The
      face of his partner had a more subtle appeal, and so light and willowy was
      her figure as she danced that it suggested a degree of slenderness that
      bordered on attenuation. Her unbonneted hair of a rich blonde hue had a
      golden lustre in the sun; her complexion was of an exquisite whiteness and
      with a delicate flush; the chiseling of her features was peculiarly fine,
      in clear, sharp lines&mdash;she was called &ldquo;hatchet-faced&rdquo; by her
      undiscriminating friends. She wore a coarse, flimsy, pink muslin dress
      which showed a repetitious pattern of vague green leaves, and as she
      flitted, lissome and swaying, through the throng, with the wind a-flutter
      in her full draperies, she might have suggested to a spectator the
      semblance of a pink flower&mdash;of the humbler varieties, perhaps, but
      still a wild rose is a rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the longest dance must have an end; even the stanchest mountain
      fiddler will reach at last his limit of endurance and must needs be
      refreshed and fed. There was a sudden significant flourish of frisky
      bowing, now up and again down, enlisting every resonant capacity of
      horsehair and catgut; the violins quavered to a final long-drawn scrape
      and silence descended. Dullness ensued; the flavor of the day seemed to
      pall; the dancers scattered and were presently following the crowd that
      began to slowly gather about the vacated stand of the musicians, from
      which elevation the speakers of the occasion were about to address their
      fellow-citizens. One of the disaffected old farmers, gruff and averse,
      could not refrain from administering a rebuke to Brent Kayle as crossing
      the expanse of saw-dust on his way to join the audience he encountered the
      youth in company with Valeria Clee, his recent partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ai-yi, Brent,&rdquo; the old man said, &ldquo;the last time I seen you uns I remember
      well ez ye war a-settin' on the mourner's bench.&rdquo; For there had been a
      great religious revival the previous year and many had been pricked in
      conscience. &ldquo;Ye ain't so tuk up now in contemplatin' the goodness o' God
      an' yer sins agin same,&rdquo; he pursued caustically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brent retorted with obvious acrimony. &ldquo;I don't see no 'casion ter doubt
      the goodness o' God&mdash;I never war so ongrateful nohow as that comes
      to.&rdquo; He resented being thus publicly reproached, as if he were
      individually responsible for the iniquity of the bran dance&mdash;the
      scape-goat for the sins of all this merry company. Many of the whilom
      dancers had pressed forward, crowding up behind the old mountaineer and
      facing the flushed Brent and the flowerlike Valeria, the faint green
      leaves of her muslin dress fluttering about her as her skirts swayed in
      the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye ain't so powerful afeard of the devil <i>now</i> ez ye uster was on
      the mourner's bench,&rdquo; the old man argued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never war so mighty afeard of the devil,&rdquo; the goaded Brent broke forth
      angrily, for the crowd was laughing in great relish of his predicament&mdash;they,
      who had shared all the enormity of &ldquo;shaking a foot&rdquo; on this festive day.
      Brent flinched from the obvious injustice of their ridicule. He felt an
      eager impulse for reprisal. &ldquo;I know ez sech dancin' ez I hev done ain't no
      sin,&rdquo; he blustered. &ldquo;I ain't afeared o' the devil fur sech ez that. I
      wouldn't be skeered a mite ef he war ter&mdash;ter&mdash;ter speak right
      out now agin it, an' I'll be bound ez all o' you uns would. I&mdash;I&mdash;look
      yander&mdash;<i>look!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had thrown himself into a posture of amazed intentness and was pointing
      upward at the overhanging boughs of a tree above their heads. A squirrel
      was poised thereon, gazing down motionless. Then, suddenly&mdash;a
      frightful thing happened. The creature seemed to speak. A strange falsetto
      voice, such as might befit so eerie a chance, sounded on the air&mdash;loud,
      distinct, heard far up the slope, and electrifying the assemblage near at
      hand that was gathering about the stand and awaiting the political
      candidates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quit yer foolin'&mdash;quit yer fooling&rdquo; the strange voice iterated.
      &ldquo;I'll larn ye ter be afeared o' the devil. Long legs now is special
      grace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So wild a cry broke from the startled group below the tree that the
      squirrel, with a sudden, alert, about-face movement, turned and swiftly
      ran along the bough and up the bole. It paused once and looked back to cry
      out again in distinct iteration, &ldquo;Quit yer foolin'! Quit yer foolin'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But none had stayed to listen. A general frantic rout ensued. The
      possibility of ventriloquism was unknown to their limited experience. All
      had heard the voice and those who had distinguished the words and their
      seeming source needed no argument. In either case the result was the same.
      Within ten minutes the grounds of the famous barbecue and bran dance were
      deserted. The cumbrous wagons, all too slow, were wending with such speed
      as their drivers could coerce the ox-teams to make along the woodland road
      homeward, while happier wights on horseback galloped past, leaving clouds
      of dust in the rear and a grewsome premonition of being hindmost in a
      flight that to the simple minds of the mountaineers had a pursuer of
      direful reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state of a candidate is rarely enviable until the event is cast and
      the postulant is merged into the elect, but on the day signalized by the
      barbecue, the bran dance, and the rout the unfortunate aspirants for
      public favor felt that they had experienced the extremest spite of fate;
      for although they realized in their superior education and sophistication
      that the panic-stricken rural crowd had been tricked by some clever
      ventriloquist, the political orators were left with only the winds and
      waters and wilderness on which to waste their eloquence, and the wisdom of
      their exclusive method of saving the country.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Brent Kayle's talent for eluding the common doom of man to eat his bread
      in the sweat of his face was peculiarly marked. He was the eldest of seven
      sons, ranging in age from eleven to twenty years, including one pair of
      twins. The parents had been greatly pitied for the exorbitant exactions of
      rearing this large family during its immaturity, but now, the labor of
      farm, barnyard and woodpile, distributed among so many stalwart fellows of
      the same home and interest was light and the result ample. Perhaps none of
      them realized how little of this abundance was compassed by Brent's
      exertions&mdash;how many days he spent dawdling on the river bank idly
      experimenting with the echoes&mdash;how often, even when he affected to
      work, he left the plow in the furrow while he followed till sunset the
      flight of successive birds through the adjacent pastures, imitating as he
      went the fresh mid-air cry, whistling in so vibrant a bird-voice, so
      signally clear and dulcet, yet so keen despite its sweetness, that his
      brothers at the plow-handles sought in vain to distinguish between the
      calls of the earth-ling and the winged voyager of the empyreal air. None
      of them had ever heard of ventriloquism, so limited had been their
      education and experience, so sequestered was their home amidst the
      wilderness of the mountains. Only very gradually to Brent himself came the
      consciousness of his unique gift, as from imitation he progressed to
      causing a silent bird to seem to sing. The strangeness of the experience
      frightened him at first, but with each experiment he had grown more
      confident, more skilled, until at length he found that he could throw a
      singularly articulate voice into the jaws of the old plow-horse, while his
      brothers, accustomed to his queer vocal tricks, were convulsed with
      laughter at the bizarre quadrupedal views of life thus elicited. This
      development of proficiency, however, was recent, and until the incident at
      the bran dance it had not been exercised beyond the limits of their
      secluded home. It had revealed new possibilities to the young
      ventriloquist and he looked at once agitated, excited, and triumphant when
      late that afternoon he appeared suddenly at the rail fence about the
      door-yard of Valeria Clee's home on one of the spurs of Chilhowee
      Mountain. It was no such home as his&mdash;lacking all the evidence of
      rude comfort and coarse plenty that reigned there&mdash;and in its
      tumbledown disrepair it had an aspect of dispirited helplessness. Here
      Valeria, an orphan from her infancy, dwelt with her father's parents, who
      always of small means had become yearly a more precarious support. The
      ancient grandmother was sunken in many infirmities, and the household
      tasks had all fallen to the lot of Valeria. Latterly a stroke of paralysis
      had given old man Clee an awful annotation on the chapter of age and
      poverty upon which he was entering, and his little farm was fast growing
      up in brambles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But 't ain't no differ, gran Mad,&rdquo; Valeria often sought to reassure him.
      &ldquo;I'll work some way out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when he would irritably flout the possibility that she could do aught
      to materially avert disaster she was wont to protest: &ldquo;You jes' watch <i>me.
      I'll</i> find out some way. I be ez knowin' ez any old <i>owel</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Despite her slender physique and her recurrent heavy tasks the drear doom
      of poverty with its multiform menace had cast no shadow on her ethereal
      face, and her pensive dark gray eyes were full of serene light as she met
      the visitor at the bars. A glimmer of mirth began to scintillate beneath
      her long brown lashes, and she spoke first. &ldquo;The folks in the mountings
      air mighty nigh skeered out'n thar boots by yer foolishness, Brent&rdquo;&mdash;she
      sought to conserve a mien of reproof. &ldquo;They 'low ez it war a manifestation
      of the Evil One.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brent laughed delightedly. &ldquo;Warn't it prime?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I never
      expected ter work sech a scatteration of the crowd Thar skeer plumb
      terrified <i>me</i>. I jes' set out with the nimblest, an' run from the
      devil myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't them candidates fur office be mighty mad if they find out what it
      war sure enough?&rdquo; she queried anxiously. &ldquo;They gin the crowd a barbecue
      an' bran dance, an' arter all, the folks got quit of hevin' ter hear them
      speak an' jaw about thar old politics an' sech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them candidates air hoppin' mad fur true,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I been down
      yander at Gilfillan's store in the Cove an' I hearn the loafers thar
      talkin' powerful 'bout the strange happening. An' them candidates war thar
      gittin' ready ter start out fur town in thar buggy. An' that thar gay one&mdash;though
      now he seems ez sober ez that sour one&mdash;he said 't warn't no devil.
      'Twar jes' a ventriloquisk from somewhar&mdash;that's jes' what that town
      man called it. But <i>I</i> never said nuthin'. I kep' powerful quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brent Kayle was as vain a man as ever stood in shoe leather&mdash;even in
      the midst of his absorption in his disclosure he could not refrain from a
      pause to reflect on the signal success of his prank and laugh and plume
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But old Gilfillan he loves ter believe ez the devil air hotfoot arter
      other folks with a pitchfork, an' he axed how then did sech a man happen
      ter be in the mountings 'thout none knowin' of it. An' that candidate, the
      gay one, he say he reckon the feller kem from that circus what is goin'
      fer show in Shaftesville termorrer&mdash;mebbe he hearn 'bout the bran
      dance an' wanted ter hev some fun out'n the country folks. That candidate
      say he hed hearn dozens o' ventriloquisks in shows in the big towns&mdash;though
      this war about the bes' one he could remember. He said he hed no doubt
      this feller is paid good money in the show, fur jes' sech fool tricks with
      his voice&mdash;<i>good money!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valeria had listened in motionless amazement But he had now paused, almost
      choking with his rush of emotion, his excitement, his sense of triumph,
      and straight ensued a certain reluctance, a dull negation, a prophetic
      recoil from responsibility that clogged his resolve. His eyes roved
      uncertainly about the familiar domestic scene, darkening now, duskily
      purple beneath the luminous pearly and roseate tints of the twilight sky.
      The old woman was a-drowse on the porch of the rickety little log-cabin
      beneath the gourd vines, the paralytic grandfather came hirpling
      unsteadily through the doorway on his supporting crutch, his pipe shaking
      in his shaking hand, while he muttered and mumbled to himself&mdash;who
      knows what?&mdash;whether of terror of the future, or regret for the past,
      or doubt and despair of to-day. The place was obviously so meagre, so
      poverty-bitten, so eloquent of the hard struggle for mere existence. If it
      had been necessary for Brent Kayle to put his hand to the plow in its
      behalf the words would never have been spoken&mdash;but &ldquo;good money&rdquo; for
      this idle trade, these facile pranks!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vallie,&rdquo; he said impulsively, &ldquo;I'm going ter try it&mdash;ef ye'll go
      with me. Ef ye war along I'd feel heartened ter stand up an' face the
      crowd in a strange place. I always loved ye better than any of the other
      gals&mdash;shucks!&mdash;whenst <i>ye</i> war about I never knowed ez they
      war alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was the after-glow of the sunset in the sky, but a crimson
      flush sprang into her delicate cheek; her eyes were evasive, quickly
      glancing here and there with an affectation of indifference, and she had
      no mind to talk of love, she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she should think of her gran'dad and gran'mam, he persisted. How had
      she the heart to deprive them of his willing aid? He declared he had
      intended to ask her to marry him anyhow, for she had always seemed to like
      him&mdash;she could not deny this&mdash;but now was the auspicious time&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;while
      the circus was in Shaftesville, and &ldquo;good money&rdquo; was to be had to provide
      for the wants of her old grandparents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Valeria had flouted the talk of love she seemed his partisan when
      she confided the matter to the two old people and their consent was
      accorded rather for her sake than their own. They felt a revivifying
      impetus in the thought that after their death Valeria would have a good
      husband to care for her, for to them the chief grief of their loosening
      hold on life was her inheritance of their helplessness and poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The courthouse in Shaftesville seemed a very imposing edifice to people
      unaccustomed to the giddy heights of a second story.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the two staring young rustics left the desk of the county court clerk
      and repaired to the dwelling of the minister of the Methodist Church near
      by, with the marriage license just procured safely stowed away in Brent's
      capacious hat, their anxieties were roused for a moment lest some delay
      ensue, as they discovered that the minister was on the point of sitting
      down to his dinner. He courteously deferred the meal, however, and as the
      bride apologetically remarked after the ceremony that they might have
      awaited his convenience were it not for the circus, he imagined that the
      youthful couple had designed to utilize a round of the menagerie as a
      wedding tour. The same thought was in the minds of the metropolitan
      managers of the organization when presently the two young wildings from
      the mountain fastness were ushered into their presence, having secured an
      audience by dint of extreme persistence, aided by a mien of mysterious
      importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found two men standing just within the great empty tent, for the
      crowd had not as yet begun to gather. The most authoritative, who was tall
      and portly, had the manner of swiftly disposing of the incident by asking
      in a peremptory voice what he could do for them. The other, lean and
      languid, looked up from a newspaper, in which he had been scanning a
      flaming circus advertisement, as he stood smoking a cigar. He said
      nothing, but concentrated an intent speculative gaze on the face of
      Valeria, who had pulled off her faint green sunbonnet and in a flush of
      eager hopefulness fanned with the slats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ventriloquist!&rdquo; the portly man repeated with a note of surprise, as Brent
      made known his gifts and his desire for an engagement. &ldquo;Oh, well&mdash;ventriloquism
      is a chestnut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then with a qualm of pity, perhaps, for the blank despair that settled
      down on the two young faces he explained: &ldquo;Nothing goes in the circus
      business but novelty. The public is tired out with ventriloquism. No
      mystery about it now&mdash;kind of thing, too, that a clever amateur can
      compass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brent, hurled from the giddy heights of imminent achievement to the depths
      of nullity, could not at once relinquish the glowing prospects that had
      allured him. He offered to give a sample of his powers. He would like to
      bark a few, he said; you couldn't tell him from a sure enough dog; he
      could imitate the different breeds&mdash;hound-dog, bull-pup, terrier&mdash;but
      the manager was definitely shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly his partner spoke. &ldquo;The girl might take a turn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the show?&rdquo; the portly man said in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Company's Una weighs two hundred pounds and has a face as broad as a
      barn-door. She shows she is afraid of the lion when she stands beside him
      in the street parade, and&mdash;curse him&mdash;he is so clever that he
      knows it, no matter how he is doped. It incites him to growl at her all
      through the pageant, and that simply queers the sweet peace of the idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think this untrained girl could take her place!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? She couldn't do worse&mdash;and she <i>could</i> look the part.
      See,&rdquo; he continued, in as business-like way as if Valeria were merely a
      bale of goods or deaf, &ldquo;ethereal figure, poetic type of beauty, fine
      expression of candor and serene courage. She has a look of open-eyed
      innocence&mdash;I don't mean <i>ignorance</i>.&rdquo; He made a subtle
      distinction in the untutored aspect of the two countenances before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you be afraid of the lion, child?&rdquo; the stout man asked Valeria. &ldquo;He
      is chained&mdash;and drugged, too&mdash;in the pageant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult for the astonished Valeria to find her voice. &ldquo;A lion?&rdquo;
       she murmured. &ldquo;I never seen a lion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? Honest?&rdquo; they both cried in amazement that such a thing could be. The
      portly man's rollicking laughter rang out through the thin walls of canvas
      to such effect that some savage caged beast within reach of the elastic
      buoyant sound was roused to anger and supplemented it with a rancorous
      snarl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valeria listened apprehensively, with dilated eyes. She thought of the
      lion, the ferocious creature that she had never seen. She thought of the
      massive strong woman who knew and feared him. Then she remembered the
      desolate old grandparents and their hopeless, helpless poverty. &ldquo;I'll resk
      the lion,&rdquo; she said with a tremulous bated voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a brave girl,&rdquo; cried the manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hev read 'bout Daniel's lions an' him in the den,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;An'
      Daniel hed consid'ble trust an' warn't afeard&mdash;an' mebbe I won't be
      afeard nuther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daniel's Lions? Daniel's Lions?&rdquo; the portly manager repeated attentively.
      &ldquo;I don't know the show&mdash;perhaps in some combination now.&rdquo; For if he
      had ever heard of that signal leonine incident recorded in Scripture he
      had forgotten it. &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; as Valeria eagerly appealed to him in behalf
      of Brent, &ldquo;we must try to give Hubby some little stunt to do in the
      performance&mdash;but <i>you</i> are the ticket&mdash;a sure winner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course the public knew, if it chose to reflect, that though apparently
      free the lion was muzzled with a strong steel ring, and every ponderous
      paw was chained down securely to the exhibition car; it may even have
      suspected that the savage proclivities of the great beast were dulled by
      drags. But there is always the imminent chance of some failure of
      precaution, and the multitude must needs thrill to the spectacle of
      intrepidity and danger. Naught could exceed the enthusiasm that greeted
      this slim, graceful Una a few days later in the streets of a distant city,
      as clad in long draperies of fleecy white she reclined against a splendid
      leonine specimen, her shining golden hair hanging on her shoulders, or
      mingling with his tawny mane as now and again she let her soft cheek rest
      on his head, her luminous dark gray eyes smiling down at the cheering
      crowds. This speedily became the favorite feature of the pageant, and the
      billboards flamed with her portrait, leaning against the lion, hundreds of
      miles in advance of her triumphal progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this unexpected success presently awoke Brent's emulation&mdash;so far
      he had not even &ldquo;barked a few.&rdquo; A liberal advance on his wife's salary had
      quieted him for a time, but when the wonders of this new life began to
      grow stale&mdash;the steam-cars, the great cities, the vast country the
      Company traversed&mdash;he became importunate for the opportunity of
      display. He &ldquo;barked a few&rdquo; so cleverly at a concert after the performance
      one evening that the manager gave him a chance to throw the very
      considerable volume of sound he could command into the jaws of one of the
      lions. &ldquo;Let Emperor speak to the people,&rdquo; he said. Forthwith he wrote a
      bit of rodomontade which he bade Brent memorize and had the satisfaction
      soon to hear from the lion-trainer, to whom was intrusted all that
      pertained to the exhibition of these kings of beasts, that the rehearsal
      was altogether satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      An immense audience was assembled in the great tent. The soaring dome of
      white canvas reflected the electric light with a moony lustre. The display
      of the three rings was in full swing. That magic atmosphere of the circus,
      the sense of simple festivity, the crises of thrilling expectancy, the
      revelation of successive wonders, the diffusive delight of a multitude not
      difficult to entertain&mdash;all were in evidence. Suddenly a ponderous
      cage was rolled in; the band was playing liltingly; the largest of the
      lions within the bars, a tawny monster, roused up and with head depressed
      and switching tail paced back and forth within the restricted limits of
      the cage, while the others looked out with motionless curiosity at the
      tiers of people. Presently with a long supple stride the gigantic, blond
      Norwegian trainer came lightly across the arena&mdash;a Hercules, with
      broad bare chest and arms, arrayed in spangled blue satin and white tights
      that forbade all suspicion of protective armor. At a single bound he
      sprang into the cage, while Brent, garbed in carnation and white, stood
      unheralded and unremarked close by outside among the armed attendants.
      There seemed no need of precaution, however, so lightly the trainer
      frolicked with the savage creatures. He performed wonderful acrobatic
      feats with them in which one hardly knew which most to admire, the agility
      and intrepidity of the man or the supple strength and curious intelligence
      of the beasts. He wrestled with them; he leaped and rolled among them; he
      put his head into their terrible full-fanged jaws&mdash;but before
      springing forth he fired his pistols loaded with blank cartridges full in
      their faces; for the instant the coercion of his eye was pretermitted
      every one treacherously bounded toward him, seeking to seize him before he
      could reach the door. Then Emperor, as was his wont, flung himself in
      baffled fury against the bars and stood erect and shook them in his wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once, to the astonishment of the people, he spoke, voicing a
      plaintive panegyric on liberty and protesting his willingness to barter
      all the luxury of his captivity for one free hour on the desert sands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surprise, absolute, unqualified, reigned for one moment. But a
      circus-going crowd is uncannily quick. The audience perceived a certain
      involuntary element of the entertainment. A storm of cat-calls ensued,
      hisses, roars of laughter. For the place was the city of Glaston, the
      Company being once more in East Tennessee, and the lion spoke the old
      familiar mountain dialect so easily recognizable in this locality. Even a
      <i>lapsus linguae</i>, &ldquo;you uns.&rdquo; was unmistakable amidst the high-flown
      periods. Although the ventriloquism was appreciated, the incongruity of
      this countrified jargon, held in great contempt by the townfolks,
      discounted Emperor's majesty and he was in ludicrous eclipse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the screening canvas the portly manager raged; &ldquo;How dare you make
      that fine lion talk like a 'hill-Billy' such as yourself&mdash;as if he
      were fresh caught in the Great Smoky Mountains!&rdquo; he stormed at the
      indignant ventriloquist. The other partners in the management interfered
      in Brent's behalf; they feared that the proud mountaineer, resenting the
      contemptuous designation &ldquo;hill-Billy&rdquo; might withdraw from the Company,
      taking his wife with him, and the loss of Valeria from the pageant would
      be well nigh irreparable, for her ethereal and fragile beauty as Una with
      her lion had a perennial charm for the public. The management therefore
      assumed the responsibility for the linguistic disaster, having confided
      the rehearsal to a foreigner, for the Norwegian lion-trainer naively
      explained that to him it seemed that all Americans talked alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      A course in elocution was recommended to Brent by the managers, and he
      fell in with this plan delightedly, but after two or three elementary
      bouts with the vowel sounds, long and short, consonants, sonant and surd,
      he concluded that mere articulation could be made as laborious as sawing
      wood, and he discovered that it was incompatible with his dignity to be a
      pupil in an art in which he had professed proficiency. Thereafter his
      accomplishment rusted&mdash;to the relief of the management&mdash;although
      he required that Valeria should be described in the advertisements as the
      wife of &ldquo;the <i>celebrated ventriloquist</i>, Mr. Brent Kayle,&rdquo; thus
      seeking by faked notoriety to secure the sweets of fame, without the labor
      of achievement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valeria had welcomed the pacific settlement of the difficulty, because her
      &ldquo;good money&rdquo; earned in the show so brightened and beautified the evening
      of life for the venerable grandparents at home. For their sake she had
      conquered her dread of the lion in the pageant. Indeed she had found other
      lions in her path that she feared more&mdash;the glitter and gauds of her
      tinsel world, the enervating love of ease, the influence of sordid
      surroundings and ignoble ideals. But not one could withstand the simple
      goodness of the unsophisticated girl. They retreated before the power of
      her fireside traditions of right thinking and true living which she had
      learned in her humble mountain home.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had come to be a dwelling of comfortable aspect, cared for in the
      absence of the young couple by a thrifty hired housekeeper, a widowed
      cousin, and here they spent the off-seasons when the circus company went
      into winter quarters. Repairs had been instituted, several rooms were
      added, and a wide veranda replaced the rickety little porch and gave upon
      a noble prospect of mountain and valley and river. Here on sunshiny noons
      in the good Saint Martin's summer the old gran'dad loved to sit, blithe
      and hearty, chirping away the soft unseasonable December days. Sometimes
      in the plenitude of content he would give Valeria a meaning glance and
      mutter &ldquo;Oh, leetle <i>Owel!</i> Oh, leetle <i>Owel!</i>&rdquo; and then break
      into laughter that must needs pause to let him wipe his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Vallie 'pears ter hev right good sense an' makes out toler'ble well,
      considerin',&rdquo; her husband would affably remark, &ldquo;though of course it war
      <i>me</i> ez interduced her ter the managers, an' she gits her main chance
      in the show through my bein' a celebrated ventriloquisk.&rdquo;
